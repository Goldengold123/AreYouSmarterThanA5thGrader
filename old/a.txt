Welcome to the game - Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader!!!\n\nThere are a total of 10 + 1 final challenging questions for you to answer.\nAs you progress, the money ladder increases - you win more money.\nOf the first 10 questions, there are 2 from each grade level (grades 1 to 5).\nThese will be prompted to you based on the grade level order.\n\n\nAt any point in the game, you may choose to drop out of school and keep your earnings: enter \"drop out\" to do so.\n\nIf you get the question correct, you will advance onto the next question.\n\nIf you get the question incorrect, depending on the question number, you will\n\t- lose all of your earnings (if you did not get past question 5)\n\t- leave with $25,000 (if you got to question 5)\n\n\nLifeline System: these can only be used in the intial 10 questions - you must complete the final question yourself.\n\n1. At any point in the game, you can peek at your classmate's answer by entering \"peek\".\nYou will be shown your classmate's answer for a brief moment before being prompted for your own answer.\nFor grade 1, 2, and 3 level questions, there is a 2/3 chance your classmate is correct.\nFor grade 4 and 5 level questions, there is a 1/3 chance your classmate is correct.\n\n2.
