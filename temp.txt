Welcome to the game - Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader!!!

There are a total of 10 + 1 final challenging questions for you to answer.
As you progress, the money ladder increases - you win more money.
Of the first 10 questions, there are 2 from each grade level (grades 1 to 5).
These will be prompted to you based on the grade level order.


At any point in the game, you may choose to drop out of school and keep your earnings: enter "drop out" to do so.

If you get the question correct, you will advance onto the next question.

If you get the question incorrect, depending on the question number, you will
    - lose all of your earnings (if you did not get past question 5)
    - leave with $25,000 (if you got to question 5)


Lifeline System: these can only be used in the intial 10 questions - you must complete the final question yourself.

1. At any point in the game, you can peek at your classmate's answer by entering "peek".
You will be shown your classmate's answer for a brief moment before being prompted for your own answer.
For grade 1, 2, and 3 level questions, there is a 2/3 chance your classmate is correct.
For grade 4 and 5 level questions, there is a 1/3 chance your classmate is correct.

2. At any point in the game, you can copy at your classmate's answer by entering "copy".
You will be forced to use your classmate's answer, regardless of whether it is correct or not.
The probabilities of correctness are identical to those of the "peek" cheat.

3. If you get a question incorrect, the "save" lifeline will be automatically used.
Your classmate's answer is automatically deployed.
The probabilities of correctness are identical to both of the above cheats.


Throughout the game, if you wish to return to the main menu, enter "0".

Good luck and have fun!
